                        <p>We fight for fair wages, safe working conditions, and respect for worker dignity. Our union represents both security guards who protect our communities and retail staff who serve our customers every day.</p>
                        <p>From major retailers like Shoprite to independent security companies, we are expanding our reach to include workers from supermarkets, clothing stores, warehouses, and supply chains across South Africa.</p>
